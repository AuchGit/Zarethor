Er ruht tief unter der Oberfläche, majestätisch und unbeweglich, doch seine Kraft ist gewaltig und stets präsent. Während andere Götter Stürme toben lassen oder Flammen entfachen, ist Galanor die feste Grundlage, auf der alles Leben wächst und gedeiht.\nSein Wesen steht für Geduld, Ausdauer und Standhaftigkeit. Galanor ist nicht der laute Kriegsgott, sondern die stille Macht, die alles trägt und verbindet. Er symbolisiert das langsame, aber sichere Wachstum der Natur und die ewige Kontinuität der Welt. Seine Präsenz ist in den Bergen, Höhlen und tiefen Wurzeln der Bäume spürbar.\n\nEigenschaften und Zuständigkeiten\n\nStabilität und Geduld: Galanor ist das unbewegliche Zentrum in einer Welt des Wandels. Er lehrt, dass wahre Stärke aus Beständigkeit und Zeit erwächst.\nWachstum und Tragkraft: Er trägt die Wälder und das Leben selbst, lässt Pflanzen wurzeln und beschützt die Erde als Geburtsstätte und letzte Ruhestätte.\nWissen und Erinnerung: In den Schichten der Erde bewahrt Galanor das Wissen der Zeit. Fossilien, Kristalle und alte Höhlen gelten als seine Zeichen und Stimmen.\nGerechtigkeit durch Konsequenz: Er spricht kein direktes Urteil, doch wer das Gleichgewicht stört, erlebt die Macht seiner Erde in Erdrutschen, Spalten oder Schweigen.\n\n\nBeziehungen zu anderen Göttern\n\nZephyrios (Sturmfürst): Ein Gegenspieler, dessen flüchtige Luft Galanors festen Grund immer wieder herausfordert.

Gemeinsam tragen sie die Geheimnisse der Tiefe und des Lebens.\nCindra (Flamme der Glut): Ein komplexes Verhältnis. Feuer kann Stein schmelzen, doch gemeinsam erschaffen sie neues Land durch Vulkane – eine Symbiose von Zerstörung und Geburt.\n\n\nKulte und Verehrung\nAnhänger Galanors sind oft Hüter der Natur, Bergbewohner, Erdenarbeiter und Druiden. Sie suchen in ihm die Kraft der Beständigkeit und die Weisheit der Erde. Tempel sind meist in Höhlen, Steinbrüchen oder an Bergflanken zu finden.\nRituale zu seinen Ehren beinhalten das Pflanzen von Bäumen, das Schmieden von Werkzeugen und das Beten um Erdbebenfreiheit und Fruchtbarkeit.\n\nMythos\nEs heißt, dass Galanor einst erwachte, als die Welt am Rand des Untergangs stand – seine Erschütterung riss Berge und Täler auf und formte Kontinente neu.
